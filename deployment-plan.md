# Deployment Plan for Rivu

## Current Structure Analysis
- Frontend code is in `/client` directory
- Backend code is partially in `/server` and partially in root directory
- Database connection is using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Project has shared types in `/shared` directory

## Frontend Deployment to Vercel
1. Client folder structure is already suitable for Vercel deployment
2. Need to update Vercel configuration to build from `/client` directory
3. Frontend should call backend API using environment variables

## Backend Deployment to Render
1. Organize all backend code into `/server` directory
2. Create proper server/package.json with backend-only dependencies
3. Ensure database connection uses environment variables 
4. Create necessary deployment files (Procfile, etc.)

## Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Complete the server directory structure
2. Update import paths in server files
3. Configure environment variables for both environments
4. Set up proper CORS for cross-domain operation
5. Test locally before deployment
6. Deploy frontend to Vercel
7. Deploy backend to Render
