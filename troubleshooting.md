# Transaction Issues Resolution Log

## Issues Identified and Fixed - 2025-05-27

### 1. âœ… CSV Transactions Assigned to Wrong User
**Problem**: When a user uploads a CSV, transactions are inserted under the wrong user ID.
**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified CSV upload controllers to use authenticated session's user ID
- Added explicit user ID validation in transaction creation
- Ensured category defaults to 'Uncategorized' when missing

**Files Modified**:
- `server/controllers-ts/transactionController.ts` - Line 495: Added category default
- `server/controllers-ts/csvController.ts` - Line 206: Added category default

### 2. âœ… Category Field Causing Insert Failures  
**Problem**: Null value in column "category" violates not-null constraint
**Fix Applied**:
- Added default category 'Uncategorized' for all CSV imports
- Ensured category field is never null in transaction creation

### 3. âœ… Clear All Transactions Button Fixed
**Problem**: "Clear All" button fails with transaction deletion errors
**Fix Applied**:
- Improved error handling in DELETE /api/transactions/all route
- Added proper user ID validation and scoping
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

### 4. âœ… Comprehensive Delete All Data Functionality
**Problem**: "Delete All Data" only deletes CSV transactions, not all user data
**Fix Applied**:
- Added `deleteAllUserData` method to storage interface
- Implemented cascade delete across all user-related tables:
  - Transactions (all sources: manual, CSV, Plaid)
  - Goals, budgets, categories, subcategories
  - Nudges, Rivu scores, accounts
  - Plaid items and accounts
- Added new API endpoint: DELETE /api/user/data/all

### 5. ðŸ”„ User ID Isolation in Transaction Operations
**Problem**: Transactions not properly scoped to logged-in user
**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced user ID validation in all transaction endpoints
- Added explicit user scoping in database queries
- Improved authentication checks

### 6. âœ… CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES - Cross-User Data Access Prevention
**Problem**: Newly registered users could see transactions from other accounts
**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced authentication middleware with strict user isolation
- Added email verification requirement before login
- Implemented unique session validation per user
- Added comprehensive security logging

### 7. âœ… Email Verification System Implementation
**Problem**: Auto-login after registration without email verification
**Fix Applied**:
- Disabled auto-login after user registration
- Implemented proper email verification workflow using Postmark
- Users must verify email before accessing any data
- Added verification email helper function with support@tryrivu.com sender

### 8. âœ… Session Security Enhancement
**Problem**: Potential session token reuse across accounts
**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced JWT token generation with user-specific data
- Added database validation for each request
- Implemented session invalidation for unverified users
- Added security event logging for audit trail
