Apply the following final fixes to ensure Rivu is stable, functional, and user-ready. Every feature must use real user data, with no broken logic or placeholders remaining.

⸻

A. TRANSACTION FORM – FIX VALIDATION ERROR

Issue:
	•	Manual transaction entry is throwing validation errors even when fields are correctly filled

Fix:
	•	Confirm required fields are:
	•	description (text)
	•	amount (positive number)
	•	date (optional default to today)
	•	Allow optional or custom entries for:
	•	category
	•	account
	•	Backend should:
	•	Accept all manually entered values
	•	Return clear validation errors (e.g., “Amount must be greater than 0”)
	•	Save to the correct user in MongoDB

⸻

B. LIGHT/DARK MODE – PERSISTENCE + SETTINGS

Fixes to Apply:
	1.	Theme Preference Persistence
	•	When user chooses dark/light mode:
	•	Store the choice in localStorage or user profile
	•	Apply consistently across all pages, including after login
	2.	Toggle in Settings Page
	•	Add a toggle switch under /settings
	•	Live update the theme on toggle
	•	Optionally, save to user’s profile in MongoDB for cross-device consistency

⸻

C. PLAID INTEGRATION – CONFIRM IT WORKS

Fix:
	•	The “Connect Bank Account” button must trigger Plaid Link flow
	•	Authenticate using sandbox credentials
	•	Upon success:
	•	Save access_token and account_id to the user’s record in MongoDB
	•	Display a proper confirmation:
“Bank account successfully linked.”
	•	If it fails:
	•	Display:
“Bank connection failed. No token received.”
	•	Remove “Feature coming soon” or any fake logic

⸻

D. BUDGETING – ADD “AMOUNT SPENT” OPTION

Fix:
	•	On both the /budget page and dashboard budget section:
	•	For each category, include a numeric field: Amount Spent
	•	When user enters a value:
	•	Save to MongoDB
	•	Recalculate budget usage %
	•	Update:
	•	Progress bar
	•	Budget summary
	•	Rivu Score, if applicable

limit: 400
spent: 160
progress = 40%

•	Value should persist across sessions and sync to dashboard

E. Final Expectations
	•	No fake or static data remains in:
	•	Rivu Score
	•	Budget
	•	Transactions
	•	Bank connections
	•	All data must come from authenticated MongoDB user context
	•	All form input must work across themes and be responsive


Account settings shows rivu score 75, remove it
