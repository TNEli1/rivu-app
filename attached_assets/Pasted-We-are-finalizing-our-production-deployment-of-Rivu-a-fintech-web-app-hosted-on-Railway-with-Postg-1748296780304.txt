We are finalizing our production deployment of Rivu — a fintech web app hosted on Railway with PostgreSQL and domain routing via Squarespace (https://tryrivu.com). Please complete the following checklist without reverting any prior fixes:

⸻

1. LEGAL + COMPLIANCE
	•	Update any mention of “California” to reflect the correct entity:
RIVU Inc., a Delaware C Corporation governed under Delaware law.
	•	Ensure Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and all user-facing disclaimers reflect this.
	•	Verify:
	•	“This is not financial advice” disclaimer is displayed near AI-generated outputs.
	•	“Rivu is not a bank or financial advisor. Banking data is securely accessed via Plaid, a third-party API provider” is present in the TOS and Plaid consent.
	•	App states it currently only supports U.S. bank accounts via Plaid.
	•	Ensure a checkbox at signup or onboarding explicitly confirms user consent to:
	•	Terms of Service
	•	Privacy Policy
	•	Use of behavioral AI and financial data
	•	Ensure a “Delete My Data” option or request mechanism exists.
	•	Verify Postmark is used for all outbound emails (e.g., email verification, newsletter, iOS interest form).
	•	Verify Plaid’s developer policy is respected:
	•	Proper attribution
	•	Clear disclosure of data usage
	•	No storing of access tokens in logs or insecure formats

⸻

2. SECURITY + DATA PROTECTION
	•	Ensure email verification is required before login.
	•	Ensure duplicate or mismatched passwords are rejected at signup.
	•	Confirm all API keys and secrets are pulled from environment variables and not hardcoded.
	•	Confirm the app uses HTTPS only and does not expose user data in logs or console.
	•	Confirm Railway PostgreSQL is being used exclusively and schema is synced.

⸻

3. FUNCTIONALITY CHECK

Verify these core features are fully operational:
	•	Google OAuth login (ensure callback URL works on Railway, not Replit preview)
	•	CSV import/export feature on the transactions page
	•	AI Coaching is hitting the OpenAI API with user-specific prompts
	•	“Connect your bank” button uses the Plaid key correctly and initiates OAuth with proper environment
	•	Postmark sends email on user signup, email verification, and iOS waitlist signup
	•	User registration flow:
	•	Fields: Name, email, password, confirm password
	•	Email verification required before login
	•	Confirm there are no open CORS issues, database sync errors, or 500s during account creation, login, or dashboard load

⸻

4. DESIGN + PERFORMANCE
	•	Optimize for mobile-first design: check responsiveness across iOS Safari and Chrome.
	•	Add:
	•	<title>, <meta name="description">, and appropriate <meta property="og:*"> tags for SEO
	•	Mobile app tags like apple-touch-icon and viewport settings
	•	Add a small badge or line on the landing page:
“iOS App Coming Soon — Sign up for early access”
	•	Use Postmark to email these signups to support@tryrivu.com

⸻

5. CLEANUP + FINALIZATION
	•	Remove all:
	•	Replit-only plugins and logic
	•	localhost references
	•	commented Replit code fragments
	•	Reconfirm:
	•	Production database URL is correct
	•	BASE_URL points to https://tryrivu.com
	•	Run database push again to ensure latest schema is active

Respond only with changes made, unresolved blockers, or security/logic issues that need human input.
