1. CSV Upload: API Endpoint Not Found
	•	Ensure the /api/transactions/upload (or equivalent) endpoint is present and matches the frontend upload call.
	•	Confirm it handles CSV files, parses them, and inserts transactions.
	•	If missing, implement it using Multer (or similar) and validate schema before DB insert.

2. Bank Connect: Initialization Failure
	•	The “Connect Bank” button throws a Connection error: Unable to initialize bank connection.
	•	Check Plaid integration: likely due to redirect domain mismatch or missing Plaid environment variables.
	•	Log and catch full Plaid error response server-side.
	•	Prepare production-ready fallback message and retry logic.

⸻

3. “Clear All Transactions” Throws 500
	•	Fix server crash when pressing “Clear All.”
	•	Likely cause: no user ID passed, or mass delete call fails DB validation.
	•	Validate authenticated user exists and confirm DELETE /api/transactions/clear route works with session context.

⸻

4. New User Tutorial Does Not Show
	•	Ensure the onboarding flow displays once upon first login.
	•	Check for missing hasSeenTutorial flag or incorrect default state.
	•	Confirm logic isn’t blocked by missing or invalid user ID.

5. User Data Deletion Fails
	•	When a user clicks “Delete all my data,” the app:
	•	Logs them out.
	•	Returns 401: No token provided afterward.
	•	Fails to fully delete user data (re-creating the account shows previous data).

Fix:
	•	Ensure user deletion logic runs before logout.
	•	Confirm it fully purges:
	•	user table record
	•	associated transactions
	•	sessions
	•	budgets/goals
	•	Add a backend confirmation log and return status after deletion completes.

⸻

6. AI Coach Error: “Knowledge Base Unavailable”
	•	Likely due to:
	•	Broken OpenAI API call
	•	Missing/inaccessible prompt logic
	•	Confirm OPENAI_API_KEY is loaded.
	•	Validate prompt construction and fallback handling when GPT fails.

⸻

7. Nudges Suggesting Already-Completed Tasks
	•	Review logic that decides when a nudge is triggered.
	•	Track nudge dismissal + goal/task completion flags per user.
	•	Ensure nudges dynamically update based on real-time user data.

⸻

8. Re-Login Blocked with 403: Email Not Verified
	•	After logout, trying to log in with a valid account returns 403: Email not verified.
	•	But no verification email is ever sent.

Fix:
	•	Ensure Postmark is sending email verification link during registration.
	•	Add UI confirmation to user post-register (“Check your inbox to verify email”).
	•	Backend: ensure emailVerified field defaults to false and updates upon verification link click.
