We’re ready to launch. Please do a comprehensive system-wide audit of the Rivu application to confirm it’s clean, secure, and production-ready.

⸻



✅ 1. USER EXPERIENCE & FLOW
	•	Check that all buttons, links, and forms across the app are functional on both desktop and mobile
	•	Ensure all routing is stable (no redirect loops, broken links, or dead endpoints)
	•	Validate keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
	•	Test app in light mode and dark mode, including persistence across sessions
	•	Verify that text is readable and properly aligned across all screen sizes

⸻

✅ 2. AUTHENTICATION + SESSION CONTROL
	•	Confirm users are properly logged in/out and tokens are cleared on logout
	•	Ensure all protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated
	•	Validate token expiration behavior and refresh handling
	•	Confirm that forgot password + reset flow works from end to end and reflects Rivu branding

✅ 6. AI COACH + NUDGES
	•	Confirm coach tone personalization (encouraging, direct, strict) is respected in prompts
	•	Coach should pull real user data (not demo/hardcoded values)
	•	Nudges must be:
	•	Contextually relevant (e.g., don’t ask for budget if already built)
	•	Non-repetitive
	•	Suppressed if not useful
	•	Coach and nudges must never leak other users’ data

⸻

✅ 7. DATA INTEGRITY + PRIVACY
	•	Confirm ALL user data (transactions, goals, budgets, scores, profile) is scoped by user ID
	•	Do a multi-account test to confirm no cross-user data leakage
