Please perform a full audit and optimization of the Rivu web app. Address the following critical areas:

⸻

✅ 1. User Data Integrity
	•	Ensure all user data is properly stored and associated with the correct user ID
	•	Verify:
	•	No user can see, query, or manipulate another user’s data
	•	Data is scoped per authenticated session/token

⸻

✅ 2. Security and Authentication
	•	Double check all authentication flows (login, password reset, session tokens, etc.)
	•	Confirm:
	•	Tokens are securely generated and stored
	•	Passwords are hashed
	•	Private routes are protected by auth middleware
	•	Skip rate limiting and HTTPS enforcement for now since we are still testing and using a Replit dev domain
	•	Make the app unhackable and secure user data at rest and in transit

⸻

✅ 3. Plaid Integration
	•	We are seeing issues with bank account connections failing
	•	Confirm the following:
	•	We are in Production mode on the Plaid dashboard (or alert us if still in Sandbox)
	•	All endpoints and credentials use production API keys
	•	The Plaid connection flow works across desktop and mobile

⸻

✅ 4. Bank Account Unlinking / Data Deletion (1033 Compliance)
	•	According to Plaid’s 1033 protocol, we must support:
	•	User-initiated account unlinking
	•	Data deletion upon request
	•	If data deletion is handled via support@tryrivu.com, confirm that deletion is being logged and fully executed in backend
	•	Add a “Unlink Bank Account” button to the app if not already present

⸻

✅ 5. Mobile and Web Optimization
	•	Ensure the app:
	•	Fully loads and functions on mobile devices
	•	Is responsive across screen sizes
	•	Does not crash or misalign elements on mobile views

⸻

✅ 6. Bug and Crash Audit
	•	Run through all pages (dashboard, transactions, budget, goals, Rivu Score, etc.)
	•	Look for:
	•	Broken links
	•	Unresponsive UI components
	•	Errors in console
	•	Incorrect data rendering

⸻

✅ 7. Final Suggestions
	•	Review for:
	•	Redundant API calls or unoptimized components
	•	Missing loading states or error handling
	•	Accessibility improvements
	•	Let us know if any cleanup, refactoring, or architecture improvements are recommended before going fully live

This should be treated as the final production-readiness sweep before domain deployment and onboarding live users.
