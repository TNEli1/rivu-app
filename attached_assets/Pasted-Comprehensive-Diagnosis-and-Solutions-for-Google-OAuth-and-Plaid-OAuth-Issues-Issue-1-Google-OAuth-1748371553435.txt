Comprehensive Diagnosis and Solutions for Google OAuth and Plaid OAuth Issues

Issue 1: Google OAuth Login Not Completing (No Session/JWT)

Problem: After Google sign-in via Passport.js, users are correctly redirected to the /auth/google/callback and their accounts are created/linked in the database. However, the login does not persist – no session is established (and no JWT is issued), so the user ends up back at the login page as if not authenticated.

Diagnosis: This is typically a session management or cookie issue in the OAuth callback flow. Given that Passport’s Google strategy successfully returns a user (since the DB entry is created), the likely culprit is that the session cookie isn’t being preserved or sent to the client. Common causes include:
	•	Cookie Domain/SameSite Mismatch: If your frontend and backend are on different domains (e.g. frontend on myapp.netlify.app and backend on myapi.herokuapp.com), the session cookie set by the backend may not be accessible to the frontend. In one case, a cookie was issued for .herokuapp.com, but when redirecting to a Netlify app, the cookie was effectively discarded . Public-suffix domains (like *.herokuapp.com or *.netlify.app) cannot set cookies for higher-level domains, causing the cookie to be lost on cross-domain redirect . This means the authenticated session never carries over to the client.
	•	Missing or Improper Session Configuration: Passport requires an Express session (or cookie-session) middleware properly configured before Passport’s initialization. If passport.serializeUser/deserializeUser are not implemented or the session middleware is misconfigured, the user won’t be serialized into the session. For example, forgetting to call app.use(session({...})) or using an incorrect session store can result in req.user not persisting beyond the callback.
	•	SameSite/Secure Flags: Modern browsers default to SameSite=Lax for cookies, which blocks cookies on cross-site redirects except for top-level navigation. If your OAuth flow involves cross-site redirects (which it does), a cookie with default or SameSite=Lax might not be saved or sent on the subsequent XHR requests from your SPA. Similarly, if your app is served over HTTPS (which it should in production) but the cookie isn’t flagged Secure, it may be dropped.
	•	Cross-Origin AJAX Calls: After redirecting back to the frontend, many SPAs call a /current_user or similar endpoint to verify login. If that call doesn’t include credentials (e.g. missing fetch or XHR with credentials: 'include' or missing CORS allow-credentials), the cookie won’t be sent, making it appear the user isn’t logged in.

Solution: Ensure the session cookie is properly configured for a production cross-domain environment, or adopt a token-based approach. Key steps and best practices:
	•	Unify Cookie Domain (Preferred): If possible, serve frontend and backend under a common parent domain and set the session cookie’s domain to that parent. For example, host frontend at app.rivu.com and backend at api.rivu.com, and set cookie.domain = '.rivu.com'. This way, when the backend sets the cookie, it’s valid for both subdomains. In the Reddit case, the fix was using a custom domain for both frontend and API (Netlify and Heroku served under a single domain) so that the cookie persisted on redirect .
	•	Set SameSite=None and Secure: Mark the session cookie for cross-site usage. In your Express session config, for example:

app.use(session({
  secret: 'your_session_secret',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: { 
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: true,         // ensure HTTPS
    sameSite: 'None',     // allow cross-site cookies
    domain: '.yourdomain.com', // domain shared by front and back (if applicable)
    maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000  // e.g. 1 day
  }
}));

Ensure you call app.set('trust proxy', 1) if behind a proxy (Heroku, etc.) so that secure cookies are set when the original request is via HTTPS.

	•	Initialize Passport with Sessions: Use app.use(passport.initialize()); app.use(passport.session()); after the session middleware. Confirm that you have passport.serializeUser((user, done) => done(null, user.id)) and passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {/* find user by ID, then done(null, user) */}); implemented. This allows Passport to store the user’s identifier in the session and retrieve the user on subsequent requests.
	•	Avoid Session Destruction on Redirect: Typically, Passport will call req.login() internally on successful authentication, which serializes the user to the session. Ensure that in the Google callback route you are not doing anything to clear the session or sending a response that might overwrite cookies. For example, if you use res.redirect to send the user to the frontend, the session cookie should be included in that redirect response. The browser will store it for the backend’s domain. You should verify in your network logs that a Set-Cookie header is present in the OAuth callback response. If it’s missing, double-check the steps above.
	•	Client-Side Handling: On the frontend, when the user is redirected back (e.g. to your home page), your app likely calls the backend to fetch the current user (to confirm the session). Make sure that call is sending the cookie. If using fetch or Axios, set credentials: 'include' (and configure CORS on the server to allow credentials). Without this, the request won’t include the session cookie and the backend will respond as if not authenticated.
	•	Alternative JWT Approach: As an optional enhancement, you can bypass cookies by issuing a JWT on the callback. For example, use { session: false } in the Google strategy, and in the callback function generate a signed JWT (containing user ID or info). Then redirect the user to the frontend with the token in the URL (often in a fragment #token=... to avoid it being sent to the server) or send it via a postMessage on an intermediate page. The SPA can then read the token and store it (e.g. in localStorage) for future API calls. This approach avoids cross-domain cookies altogether. Note: If you do this, use HTTPS and secure storage for the token, and consider the security implications (JWT should be short-lived or refreshable and revocable in some way).

Production Best-Practices: Use a persistent session store in production (Redis, database, etc.) instead of the default in-memory store to avoid losing sessions on server restart. Set a reasonable cookie.maxAge and implement session rolling or renewal if you want to keep users logged in. Also, log the OAuth callback events – e.g. log req.user and req.sessionID in /auth/google/callback – this helps to verify that Passport is actually serializing the user. If the log shows a user and session ID, but the client still isn’t logged in, it’s almost certainly the cookie not being persisted or sent. Adjusting the domain and SameSite as described should solve that in a production scenario .

Issue 2: Plaid OAuth Flow – oauth_state_id Missing on Return

Problem: When a user connects a bank that uses OAuth (e.g. Chase) via Plaid Link, the flow breaks upon returning from the bank’s site. The frontend generates a random oauth_state_id (stored in sessionStorage) along with the link_token when starting Plaid Link. After the user authenticates on the bank’s site, Plaid should redirect back to your app’s callback (e.g. /plaid-callback) with an oauth_state_id in the query string. In theory, the backend would use this to complete the link (or forward it to the frontend to resume Plaid Link). In practice, you’re seeing “Missing oauth_state_id” errors and the token exchange never occurs. This means the app isn’t properly resuming the Plaid flow after the OAuth redirect.

Diagnosis: The OAuth state ID is a token that ties the two halves of Plaid’s Link flow together – (1) the initial link session (user picks bank and leaves to OAuth) and (2) the completion session (user returns after OAuth). Plaid’s documentation emphasizes that Link must be re-initialized with the same link_token and given the oauth_state_id on the second half . A “missing or invalid oauth_state_id” error usually indicates one of the following:
	•	The app did not properly reinitialize Plaid Link upon returning. If the receivedRedirectUri (which includes the oauth_state_id) isn’t provided to Plaid Link on resume, Plaid can’t match the new session to the old, resulting in an error. For example, including receivedRedirectUri too early (during first init) or not at all during the second init will cause a state mismatch . It’s crucial to only use receivedRedirectUri on the post-OAuth re-init, not on the first launch of Link.
	•	The link_token used on reinit is wrong or expired. If a different link token is generated for the second stage, or if the original token wasn’t cached, Plaid will treat it as a new session without a matching state. This can cause errors like invalid token or missing state . The state ID is tied to the original link token’s session.
	•	The oauth_state_id was lost or not transmitted correctly. Relying solely on sessionStorage or React state (useMemo) for the state can fail if the page context reloads or if the redirect opens in a new context. For instance, if the OAuth redirect returns in a new tab or the original tab’s state was cleared, the app might not have the original oauth_state_id or link token in memory to compare or use.

Solution: Implement Plaid’s recommended OAuth Link flow by persisting the link token and correctly handling the redirect in the frontend. Here’s a concrete plan:
	1.	Generate Link Token with Redirect URI: Ensure when you create the link token on your backend (via /link/token/create), you include your OAuth redirect URI (e.g. https://yourapp.com/plaid-callback or a dedicated OAuth landing page). This URI must be registered in your Plaid dashboard. The link token creation response does not include an oauth_state_id – Plaid will generate it later during the OAuth handoff.
	2.	Store the Link Token (and possibly metadata): After your frontend receives the link_token, store it in a durable place accessible after redirect. The Plaid docs suggest using localStorage or a cookie for this . sessionStorage is only available to the original tab and origin; if the OAuth flow navigates away and back, you might lose the React state or even sessionStorage depending on how the redirect returns. localStorage is a safer choice here (since it persists even after navigation). For example:

localStorage.setItem('plaid_link_token', linkToken);

You do not need to pre-generate an oauth_state_id yourself – Plaid will attach one to the redirect URL automatically.

	3.	Launch Plaid Link (Initial Phase): Initialize Plaid Link without any receivedRedirectUri (and without your own state param). For instance, using react-plaid-link:

const config = {
    token: linkToken,
    onSuccess: (publicToken, metadata) => { /* handle success */ },
    onExit: (err, metadata) => { /* handle early exit */ }
    // NO receivedRedirectUri here on first launch
};
const { open } = usePlaidLink(config);
// ... on button click, call open()

Do not include oauth_state_id in this config – Plaid will handle generating the state internally. Including receivedRedirectUri at this stage will confuse Link .

	4.	OAuth Redirect Happens: If the user selects an OAuth institution (like Chase), Plaid will redirect the user to the bank’s site for authentication. Once the user completes that, Plaid (via the bank) will redirect back to your specified redirect URI. The redirect URL will look like:

https://yourapp.com/plaid-callback?oauth_state_id=<some-guid>

At this moment, the user’s browser is hitting your /plaid-callback route. The oauth_state_id is present in the query string.

	5.	Resume Plaid Link on Redirect Page: There are two ways to handle this, but the recommended approach is to let the frontend re-open Plaid Link:
	•	Frontend Reinitialization: Have the redirect URI point to a frontend route/page (e.g. a dedicated React component or simple HTML page) that knows how to continue the Link flow. This page should:
	•	Retrieve the stored link_token (from localStorage or a cookie).
	•	Get the full redirect URL (including query params). In a React app, you can use window.location.href to get the current URL which contains oauth_state_id.
	•	Re-initialize Plaid Link with the same link token and the receivedRedirectUri set. For example:

const linkToken = localStorage.getItem('plaid_link_token');
const config = {
  token: linkToken,
  receivedRedirectUri: window.location.href,  // includes ?oauth_state_id=...
  onSuccess: (publicToken, metadata) => { 
    // Now we have the public_token after OAuth!
    // send to backend for exchange / item creation
  },
  onExit: (...) => { ... }
};
const { open, ready } = usePlaidLink(config);
useEffect(() => {
  if (ready) open();  // automatically open Link to resume flow
}, [ready]);

const linkToken = localStorage.getItem('plaid_link_token');
const config = {
  token: linkToken,
  receivedRedirectUri: window.location.href,  // includes ?oauth_state_id=...
  onSuccess: (publicToken, metadata) => { 
    // Now we have the public_token after OAuth!
    // send to backend for exchange / item creation
  },
  onExit: (...) => { ... }
};
const { open, ready } = usePlaidLink(config);
useEffect(() => {
  if (ready) open();  // automatically open Link to resume flow
}, [ready]);
