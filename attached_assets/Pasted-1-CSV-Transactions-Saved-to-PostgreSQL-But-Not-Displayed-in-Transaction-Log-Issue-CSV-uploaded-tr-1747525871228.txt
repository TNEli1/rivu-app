1. CSV Transactions Saved to PostgreSQL But Not Displayed in Transaction Log

Issue:
CSV-uploaded transactions are confirmed to be stored in PostgreSQL, but they do not appear in the frontend transaction log view.

Requirements:
	•	DO NOT exclude or discard transactions if fields like category, source, or type are missing.
	•	Instead, gracefully handle or sort incomplete transactions so that they still display, even if some fields are null or empty.
	•	Ensure user ID filtering is correct, so only that user’s transactions are shown.
	•	Confirm that CSV transactions are being included in API responses used to populate the transaction log and are rendered properly in the UI.

2. Date Saved One Day Earlier Than Selected

Issue:
When selecting May 17 via the date picker, transactions are saved as May 16.

Requirements:
	•	Use the user’s local time zone (Pacific Time) for all date operations—frontend and backend.
	•	Ensure that all transaction timestamps reflect the actual local date selected.
	•	Avoid saving or converting to UTC unless you’re applying the correct time zone offsets on both save and fetch.
	•	Audit all places where new Date() or toISOString() is used—ensure there’s no unintentional time shifting.
	•	Check how dates are stored in PostgreSQL (DATE, TIMESTAMP, etc.) and ensure there is no mismatch between storage format and frontend rendering logic.

3. Password Reset Emails Failing to Send (Postmark Integration)

Issue:
When a user submits a password reset request, an error message appears: “Unable to send email.”

Requirements:
	•	Ensure Postmark is properly configured in .env with:
	•	Valid POSTMARK_API_TOKEN
	•	Valid SENDER_EMAIL domain
	•	Add detailed error logging for all outbound Postmark requests (status code, error body, etc.).
	•	Confirm Replit allows outbound HTTPS requests to Postmark’s API.
	•	If the issue is from rate limits, incorrect headers, or malformed body—fix the request structure.
	•	Trigger a manual test password reset and confirm receipt of the email.

Action Items Checklist:
	•	CSV-uploaded transactions must be queryable and displayable, even if partially incomplete. No silent exclusions.
	•	Date fields must match user-selected local dates exactly (e.g., selecting May 17 must never show as May 16).
	•	Password reset emails via Postmark must send successfully, with full error logging if something fails.

Please investigate all root causes, correct the issues, and confirm that the fixes work under real user conditions.
