Please investigate and resolve the following critical issues related to the Transactions page in the Rivu app:

⸻

1. “Clear All Transactions” Button:
	•	The “Clear All Transactions” button worked on the first use, but now consistently shows a “Failed to delete” error.
	•	This suggests that either:
	•	The deletion request is no longer reaching the server, or
	•	The server route is failing to execute or return a proper status code.
	•	Please verify:
	•	That the DELETE endpoint for batch deletion is correctly implemented and still accessible.
	•	That user authentication is passed along with the request so the server knows which transactions to clear.
	•	That the database call correctly removes all relevant transactions and triggers a UI refresh to reflect the empty state.

2. User-Defined Transaction Accounts Not Persisting:
	•	When a user manually enters a transaction with a new account name (e.g., “CHASE 1234”), this information is not being saved to PostgreSQL.
	•	This results in users having to retype the same account name each time.
	•	Fix:
	•	Ensure that custom account names are stored in a dedicated accounts table (or similar structure) and linked to the correct user ID.
	•	When users manually enter a new account, check if it exists — if not, save it.
	•	Preload saved accounts in the UI for future use via dropdown or autosuggest.

⸻

3. CSV Upload: Transactions Not Displaying:
	•	CSV-uploaded transactions are being successfully stored in PostgreSQL, but they do not appear on the transactions log in the UI.
	•	Possible causes:
	•	The UI isn’t refreshing after upload.
	•	The fetch request that populates the transactions log is not pulling the latest data.
	•	There may be filtering logic (e.g., date range, source type) that is inadvertently excluding these entries.
	•	Fix:
	•	Ensure the frontend fetches and displays all transactions, regardless of entry method (manual, CSV, Plaid).
	•	Tag source types internally if needed but do not hide them from the default list view.

Please address all three of these issues thoroughly and test each flow to confirm resolution. This is part of a v1 release push and must be production-ready.
