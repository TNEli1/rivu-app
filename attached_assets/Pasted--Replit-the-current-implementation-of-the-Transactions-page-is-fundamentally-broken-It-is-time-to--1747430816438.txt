Replit, the current implementation of the Transactions page is fundamentally broken. It is time to rebuild this completely from scratch to ensure the layout is clean, the logic is sound, and all user data is stored, retrieved, and displayed properly.

⸻

1. DELETE ALL EXISTING CODE
	•	Remove all existing code for the /transactions page.
	•	Do not reuse any broken UI, CSS, or logic from the current version.

⸻

2. LAYOUT STRUCTURE

Header
	•	Title: "Transactions" top-left
	•	Large font (24px or greater), bold, clear — no icons overlapping

Search Bar
	•	Input field: placeholder "Search transactions…"
	•	Icon must be aligned right INSIDE the input field, not overlapping text
	•	Add spacing with padding-left or use input-group style if needed

⸻

3. TRANSACTION FORM (ALL FIELDS VALIDATED AND CONNECTED TO MONGODB)

Field	Type	Required	Notes
Amount	number	Yes	Dollar sign must not overlap input text – fix CSS or prepend label outside of input box
Merchant	text	Yes	Manual input
Category	dropdown	Yes	Default values: Rent, Groceries, Utilities, Transportation, Entertainment, Health, Income, Other
Subcategory	dropdown	Yes	Must dynamically change based on category. E.g.:

•	Utilities → Electric, Gas, Water
	•	Transportation → Fuel, Uber, Train
| Account      | dropdown + input | Yes |
	•	Allow users to create new named accounts (e.g., “Chase Checking”)
	•	BUG: Currently this does not save — fix this by saving to MongoDB with userId
	•	Accounts should be persistent and auto-populate dropdown in future sessions
| Type         | dropdown | Yes    | Income or Expense |
| Date         | date picker | Yes | Replace broken logic. Use a working input[type="date"] and:
	•	Store as ISO format or new Date()
	•	Allow backdated and future-dated entries
	•	Confirm backend accepts custom dates
| Submit       | button | Yes | Full-width, large, responsive

On submit:
	•	Validate all fields
	•	Save transaction to MongoDB
	•	Re-render transaction list immediately without page reload
	•	Show success toast or message

⸻

4. TRANSACTION LIST (BELOW FORM)
	•	Display all transactions (newest first) with:
	•	Date
	•	Merchant
	•	Amount
	•	Category → Subcategory
	•	Account
	•	Type
	•	Add Edit and Delete buttons
	•	Edit should prefill form with data
	•	On delete, remove from list and MongoDB instantly

⸻

5. FULL INTEGRATION WITH DASHBOARD
	•	The dashboard’s “Recent Transactions” log must mirror the same dataset
	•	Ensure shared state, same query logic, and scoped by authenticated userId

⸻

6. DATABASE INTEGRITY
	•	All new accounts and transactions must:
	•	Save to MongoDB
	•	Include authenticated userId
	•	Be retrieved only by the logged-in user
	•	BUG FIX: Prevent all data leakage between accounts
	•	Verify getTransactions(userId) and getAccounts(userId) only return the current user’s data

⸻

7. DESIGN AND UX FIXES
	•	Fix dollar sign overlap in amount field
	•	Either prepend $ with label element or add margin in input field
	•	Ensure category/subcategory dropdowns are side-by-side on large screens and stacked on mobile
	•	Use rounded cards, spacing (16–24px), readable font sizes
	•	Maintain dark mode aesthetic consistent with Rivu’s style
	•	Add hover/focus states for all inputs and buttons
	•	Add loading state if data is being fetched from Mongo

⸻

8. FINAL CHECKLIST
	•	All buttons function (submit, edit, delete)
	•	Date field accepts and stores custom dates
	•	Category/subcategory logic is dynamic and required
	•	New account names save and reappear in future sessions
	•	Transactions sync with dashboard log
	•	All data stored/retrieved securely per user
	•	No placeholder values or test data remaining
	•	Fully mobile-responsive layout
