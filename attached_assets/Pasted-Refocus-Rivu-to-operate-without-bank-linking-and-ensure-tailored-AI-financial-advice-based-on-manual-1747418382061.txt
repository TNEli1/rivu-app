Refocus Rivu to operate without bank linking and ensure tailored AI financial advice based on manual user input. This is for a stable, clean, and production-ready MVP launch.

⸻

1. Remove All Bank Linking (Plaid)
	•	Completely remove all Plaid integrations, including sandbox logic and default transactions.
	•	Replace with manual transaction entry.
	•	Optional: Add support for uploading a CSV of past transactions (parse and categorize them client-side or server-side).

⸻

2. Ensure Manual Data Flow Only
	•	Users will manually enter:
	•	Income
	•	Budget categories
	•	Savings goals
	•	Transactions
	•	All data must be stored securely in MongoDB (or Postgres if migrated).
	•	Prevent placeholder, demo, or hardcoded data from appearing.

⸻

3. Repair and Improve Rivu Score Logic
	•	Rebalance weights: Budget Adherence (40%), Savings Progress (30%), Weekly Engagement (20%), Goal Completion Rate (10%)
	•	Recalculate on any data update (budget, savings, transactions, logins).
	•	Store in backend, and display real-time score + dynamic label (Excellent, Good, Fair, Needs Improvement).
	•	Sync the updated score into the AI prompt logic.

4. Inject Smart GPT Prompting Logic

Replace generic GPT prompts with one of the following tailored templates. Use user-entered values to dynamically populate each prompt before calling the GPT API.

⸻

Prompt 1 – Budget Overview:

You're an AI personal finance coach helping users improve their budgeting. Analyze the following user data and provide 2–3 personalized, actionable tips to help them stay on track or improve their habits:

- Monthly Income: ${{userIncome}}
- Budget Status:
  - Groceries: ${{spentGroceries}} spent out of ${{budgetGroceries}}
  - Entertainment: ${{spentEntertainment}} spent out of ${{budgetEntertainment}}
  - Subscriptions: ${{spentSubs}} spent out of ${{budgetSubs}}
- Rivu Score: {{rivuScore}} – {{scoreRating}}

Keep your response under 150 words. Be clear, constructive, and encouraging.

Prompt 2 – Goal-Focused:

You're an AI financial mentor. A user has entered the following savings goals and progress. Help them improve their consistency and mindset with 2–3 actionable tips:

- Emergency Fund: Saved ${{emergencySaved}} out of ${{emergencyTarget}}
- Travel Fund: Saved ${{travelSaved}} out of ${{travelTarget}}
- Other goals: {{goalSummary}}

They currently have a Rivu Score of {{rivuScore}}. Offer insight and encouragement to improve their savings behavior and hit more goals.

Prompt 3 – Monthly Reflection:

You're an AI personal finance coach offering a monthly recap. Based on the user's activity, spending habits, and savings progress, give them a short summary and 2 clear recommendations for next month.

- Total Income: ${{income}}
- Total Spent: ${{spentTotal}}
- Total Saved: ${{savedTotal}}
- Rivu Score: {{rivuScore}} – {{scoreRating}}

Focus on one area of improvement and one area to maintain. Keep the tone practical and supportive.

Randomly rotate or select based on user input completeness. Ensure no dummy data is included in the prompt sent to GPT.

5. Remove Broken and Outdated UI
	•	Delete popups like “Welcome” or “Registration Successful”
	•	Remove demo profiles, sample transactions, and broken nav buttons
	•	Fix any broken routing (e.g., Dashboard → Goals, Goals → Back)
	•	Ensure all nav works correctly for:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Budgeting
	•	Goals
	•	Transactions
	•	Advice

⸻

6. Final UX Behavior
	•	After login, user should be prompted to:
	•	Enter income
	•	Set 3+ budget categories
	•	Add 1 goal
	•	Then view their Rivu Score
	•	Then receive 1 AI tip

This is the full MVP loop.

⸻

Once complete, confirm:
	•	Rivu Score updates correctly
	•	GPT responds with meaningful advice using real user data
	•	No use of Plaid or placeholder logic
	•	App looks stable and clean for public demo or investor pitch
