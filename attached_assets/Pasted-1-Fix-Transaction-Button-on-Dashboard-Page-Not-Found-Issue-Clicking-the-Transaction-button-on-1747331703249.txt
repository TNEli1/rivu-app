1. Fix “Transaction” Button on Dashboard (Page Not Found)

Issue:
Clicking the Transaction button on the dashboard leads to a “404 Page Not Found” error.

Fix Instructions:
	•	Inspect the route the button is trying to link to. Confirm whether it points to:

/transactions

or some other route.

	•	Confirm the actual frontend route is properly defined in your React router (or routing system), e.g.:

<Route path="/transactions" element={<TransactionsPage />} />

•	If the button uses href or navigate, confirm it exactly matches the registered route.
	•	Also ensure:
	•	The route component is correctly exported/imported
	•	There are no typos in filenames (e.g., TransactionsPage.jsx vs transactionsPage.tsx)

2. Scan Entire Dashboard UI for Broken Links and Routing Bugs

Run a pass through every dashboard button, link, and nav item. Validate:
	•	All navigate() or Link to statements match an existing registered route
	•	All destination components are properly imported
	•	There are no dynamic route mismatches (e.g., /transactions/:id without a defined base path)

⸻

3. Add Error Boundaries + Fallback UI

Wrap dashboard routes in an error boundary component to prevent silent React crashes and give useful feedback if something breaks.

<ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong. Please reload.</div>}>
  <Dashboard />
</ErrorBoundary>

4. Check Console Logs and Network Panel for Errors

Run the app and:
	•	Open DevTools
	•	Check the console and network tab
	•	Look for:
	•	404s
	•	Missing component errors
	•	Route not matched warnings
	•	Failed MongoDB fetches
	•	Log all major route loads (console.log("Loading: /transactions")) to verify nav flow

⸻

Final Deliverables:
	•	Fix Transaction button 404
	•	Validate and fix all dashboard navigation
	•	Catch broken imports, missing components, or mismatched route paths
	•	Wrap routes in error boundaries for dev feedback
	•	Log failed network requests and component load errors

3. Refactor and Improve the AI Coach UI

Current Problem:
The AI Coach section looks flat, unpolished, and generic.

Improvement Instructions:
	•	Visually polish the AI Coach box:
	•	Use a rounded card layout with a shadow and padding
	•	Add a GPT-style typewriter animation or fade-in when showing new advice
	•	Include a floating assistant avatar/icon on the left to give it a “coach” feel
	•	Use light gradients or soft backgrounds behind advice text

•	Example UI improvements:

.ai-advice {
  background: #f8f9fc;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  font-style: italic;
  animation: fadeIn 0.6s ease-in-out;
}

	•	Make sure the advice text includes the Rivu Score and user data clearly and is formatted as actual sentences — not code-style dumps.

4. Visually Modernize the Entire Web App

Issue:
The app looks dated and low-fidelity. We need to elevate the design to feel clean, professional, and modern.

Design Overhaul Checklist:
	•	Typography: Use a modern Google Font like Inter, Poppins, or Manrope
	•	Spacing: Add consistent margin/padding around cards, forms, and sections
	•	UI Components: Use rounded corners, drop shadows, and hover effects
	•	Colors: Extract a primary color palette from the logo and apply it consistently:
	•	Accent buttons, link hover, progress bars, headings
	•	Navigation: Sticky sidebar or topbar with subtle animations and selected state highlighting
	•	Transitions: Use transition: all 0.3s ease; on buttons, inputs, and modal elements
	•	Dark Mode Ready: Use CSS variables or tailwind dark: variants if applicable

Optional:
Install a lightweight UI kit or component library like Tailwind UI, Chakra UI, or Radix UI for structure and polish.

1. Fix “Transaction” Button Under Welcome Header (404 Error)

Issue:
On the main dashboard, right below the line:
“Welcome back, Elisha. Here’s your financial overview for May 2025”,
the Transaction button is broken — clicking it results in a Page Not Found (404) error.

Fix Instructions:
	•	This button should route to the /transactions page or equivalent.
	•	Validate:
	•	The route exists in the router:

<Route path="/transactions" element={<TransactionsPage />} />

	•	The TransactionsPage component is imported and exported correctly
	•	The button uses navigate('/transactions') or <Link to="/transactions"> properly
	•	The casing of file names and imports matches exactly
