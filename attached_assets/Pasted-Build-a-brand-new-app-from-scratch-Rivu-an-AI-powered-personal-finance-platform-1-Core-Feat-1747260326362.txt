Build a brand-new app from scratch: Rivu — an AI-powered personal finance platform.

⸻

1. Core Features

A. Budgeting
	•	Allow users to create/edit/delete budget categories (e.g. Rent, Food, Subscriptions)
	•	Track how much is spent in each category vs. budget
	•	Visualize category usage with progress bars

B. Transactions
	•	Simulate transaction history with realistic data
	•	Let users assign transactions to categories
	•	Calculate total spent per category + remaining balance

C. Rivu Score
	•	Score ranges from 0 to 100, based on:
	•	% of budget categories staying under budget
	•	% of savings goals completed (optional dummy logic)
	•	Weekly user activity
	•	Display in a circular ring with animated fill and color (green/yellow/red)
	•	Include a visual breakdown of score factors

D. AI Coaching (Smart Advice)
	•	Use the OpenAI API to generate personalized finance tips based on user behavior
	•	Display GPT advice in a coaching panel or advice section
	•	Add fallback text if API fails (e.g., “You’re doing great — keep it up!”)

2. UI Design Requirements
	•	Use TailwindCSS
	•	Dark mode default
	•	Color palette:
	•	Background: #121212
	•	Text: #F2F2F2
	•	Accent: #00C2A8 (teal-green)
	•	Highlights: #D0F500, #2F80ED, #FF4D4F
	•	Rounded cards, light shadows, minimalistic design
	•	Smooth animations for transitions, hover states, and score updates
	•	Mobile-responsive layout

⸻

3. Technical Setup
	•	Frontend: React with TailwindCSS
	•	Backend: Simulated with Node-style API structure (no database needed for now)
	•	Plaid: Simulated integration
	•	Preload dummy accounts and transactions
	•	Structure app logic and JSON responses like real Plaid transactions
	•	Make it easy to swap in live Plaid keys later
	•	OpenAI: Integrate GPT for coaching (use test keys for now)

⸻

4. Quality Expectations
	•	All components should be visually clean, formatted correctly, and responsive
	•	Do not include any features not listed above
	•	Simulate demo user accounts on first login
	•	No placeholders, null values, or broken states
	•	Ensure navigation is smooth and routes are functional

This is a focused MVP for user demo, investor review, and future backend integration.

Let me know once the app is up so I can review and deploy it.
