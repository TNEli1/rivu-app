Implement the following updates and resolve all outstanding issues. Treat this as a hardening pass before public release.

⸻

1. All Buttons Must Be Fully Functional

Action:
	•	Audit every page and verify that every button performs its intended function:
	•	Save / Edit / Delete actions must persist changes to MongoDB or relevant backend store
	•	Navigation buttons (e.g., “Back,” “View More,” “Save Goal,” “Add Transaction”) must redirect or reload properly
	•	All click handlers must be connected and responsive
	•	If any button has placeholder code, missing handlers, or is visually present but non-functional — fix it or remove it

2. Fix Transaction Log Date Entry (Still Broken)

Problem:
	•	Users are still unable to add transactions for any date other than today

Fix:
	•	Ensure the transaction form’s date input field:
	•	Is a fully functioning <input type="date" /> in the frontend
	•	Sends a properly formatted ISO date string to the backend
	•	On backend POST /api/transactions:

date: validated.date ? new Date(validated.date) : new Date()

	•	Validate that validated.date is respected and stored accurately

Test Case:
	•	Create a transaction for 7 days ago
	•	Confirm in database and UI that the transaction shows correct date

3. Add Subcategories and Defaults for Budgeting & Transactions

Schema Update:
	•	Add optional subCategory field to budget and transactions

Category Suggestions:

{
  "Housing": ["Rent", "Mortgage", "Property Tax", "HOA Fees"],
  "Utilities": ["Electric", "Water", "Gas", "Internet", "Trash"],
  "Groceries": ["Produce", "Meat & Seafood", "Snacks", "Beverages"],
  "Transportation": ["Gas", "Car Payment", "Insurance", "Rideshare"],
  "Entertainment": ["Streaming", "Dining Out", "Movies", "Events"],
  "Health": ["Doctor", "Dentist", "Pharmacy", "Insurance"],
  "Savings": ["Emergency Fund", "Vacation", "Investments"],
  "Income": ["Primary Job", "Side Hustle", "Freelance"]
}

Frontend Behavior:
	•	Category dropdown shows suggestions
	•	Subcategory dropdown appears after category is selected
	•	Users can skip or enter custom subcategories
	•	Maintain backwards compatibility (don’t break existing users)

⸻

4. Fix Sidebar Bug on Goals Page

Issue: Navigating to the Goals page removes the sidebar
Fix: Render Goals within the same layout as other pages — it should not be a full redirect or route that uses a standalone component

⸻

5. Clean Up UX Consistency
	•	Remove “Update Spending” button from Budget view (redundant with Edit)
	•	Fix sign-up screen link: “Already have an account? Log in” must navigate to login screen
	•	Ensure all pages render properly inside layout with sidebar and consistent header/footer

⸻

6. Validate MongoDB User Isolation
	•	Every record (transactions, budget, goals, scores) must be stored with and filtered by userId
	•	Fix any bug where one user’s data appears under another account
	•	Ensure user context is passed to all queries

⸻

7. Fix Rivu Score Refresh Button
	•	Button must trigger a fresh score calculation:

await storage.calculateRivuScore(userId);

	•	Update UI immediately after response returns
	•	Ensure score is not cached unless explicitly requested

⸻

Once these are complete, confirm:
	•	All data is stored properly
	•	All pages and features work across users
	•	No errors or null returns
	•	UX is consistent across screens
