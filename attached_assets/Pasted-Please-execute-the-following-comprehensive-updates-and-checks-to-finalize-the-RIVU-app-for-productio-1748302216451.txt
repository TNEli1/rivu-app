Please execute the following comprehensive updates and checks to finalize the RIVU app for production deployment via Railway:

⸻

1. Fix Current Deployment Error
	•	Resolve the error:
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
	•	This is likely from a path.resolve() call receiving undefined in vite.config.ts or related build config.
	•	Ensure any path array elements or root values are explicitly defined.
	•	Validate that environment-based logic isn’t returning undefined paths.
	•	For example:

root: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, 'client'),
build: {
  outDir: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, 'dist/public'),
  emptyOutDir: true
}

2. Push All Latest Database Schema Changes
	•	Use the schema to push latest updates to Railway’s PostgreSQL instance.
	•	Make sure tables for:
	•	users
	•	budgets
	•	transactions
	•	goals
	•	RivuScore
	•	Plaid account linkage
	•	early access signups
…are synced with the latest code.

⸻

3. Security & Data Isolation
	•	Ensure users cannot access data belonging to other accounts (e.g., Eli seeing Eli33’s data).
	•	Enforce tenant-level isolation in every DB query and API route using userId or session.user.id.

⸻

4. Google OAuth + Waitlist
	•	Ensure Google OAuth login works and no longer redirects to a 404.
	•	Use .env secrets for GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET.
	•	Waitlist form on landing page should trigger Postmark email to support@tryrivu.com.

⸻

5. Coach / GPT Usage
	•	Only invoke GPT when:
	•	A user explicitly prompts via the Coach screen
	•	A behavioral “nudge” is triggered
	•	Prevent GPT API usage from triggering unnecessarily (preserve tokens).

⸻

6. Transaction Categorization Engine
	•	Enable automatic categorization of Plaid transactions using plaid.transaction.category.
	•	Add logic to map transactions into core categories: groceries, rent, travel, food, etc.
	•	Display proper icons for each category (e.g., vegetable emoji for groceries).
	•	Include insights: monthly category totals, trending increases, overspending warnings.

⸻

7. Terms of Service & Privacy Policy
	•	Fix 404 links on /terms and /privacy.
	•	Update language to reflect:
	•	RIVU Inc. is a Delaware C Corporation governed under Delaware law.
	•	“We are not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice.”
	•	Data accessed via Plaid for U.S. banks only.
	•	Arbitration clause:
“By agreeing to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you consent to resolve all disputes via binding arbitration or mediation in accordance with AAA rules, and waive class-action rights.”

⸻

8. Compliance Checklist
	•	Include email verification step before users can log in.
	•	Add “Delete My Data” flow (button or email trigger).
	•	Document how user data is:
	•	Stored (e.g. encrypted at rest in PostgreSQL via Railway)
	•	Processed (you are a processor, not a controller under CCPA/GDPR).
	•	Ensure Plaid and Postmark API integrations follow vendor usage policies.

⸻

9. Landing Page Enhancements
	•	Improve / with Framer (or CSS animations) to add:
	•	Motion/scroll-based animations
	•	App screenshots with motion
	•	Waitlist form
	•	Optimize for SEO and mobile (responsive layout, meta tags, robots.txt)

⸻

10. Final Checks
	•	Confirm all environment variables are working:
	•	Postmark (email)
	•	GPT (coaching)
	•	Plaid (bank connections)
	•	Google OAuth (auth)
	•	Remove deprecated code, unused plugins, localhost references.
	•	Ensure HTTPS works and all domains are correctly resolved (www.tryrivu.com and root).
