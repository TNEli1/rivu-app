Please investigate and fix the following critical issues affecting the Transactions system in the Rivu personal finance web app:

⸻

1. “Clear All Transactions” Button Not Working
	•	The “Clear All Transactions” button no longer deletes transactions, even though the UI previously showed a success popup.
	•	Likely causes:
	•	The DELETE route is no longer processing the request correctly.
	•	The response is not triggering a state refresh on the frontend.
	•	Transaction deletions may be failing silently due to user ID mismatch, bad route binding, or a missing database commit.

What to check:
	•	Confirm that the route handling the bulk delete (e.g., DELETE /api/transactions) exists and is properly authenticated.
	•	Log the userId used in the delete operation — make sure it matches the currently logged-in user.
	•	Ensure await is used when calling the deletion logic (e.g., Transaction.deleteMany() in PostgreSQL).
	•	After deletion, trigger a refetch of the updated transaction list to refresh the frontend state.

2. Date Consistency Issue:
	•	Manually added transactions are being posted with the date May 16, even though it’s already May 17 at midnight local time.
	•	Root problem is likely a timezone mismatch between the client and the server.

What to do:
	•	Check whether the server is applying new Date() or Date.now() without adjusting for the user’s local time.
	•	Use a consistent format (e.g., ISO 8601) and either:
	•	Convert all dates to UTC on input and back to local time on display, or
	•	Store and interpret dates in the user’s timezone if captured in their profile.
	•	Update the UI date picker to explicitly display and pass the user’s selected date, not system time.

⸻

3. CSV Upload Not Populating Transaction Log
	•	CSV uploads appear to be writing to PostgreSQL, but the transactions do not appear in the frontend log.
	•	This is a critical UI/backend desync.

Likely causes:
	•	Data validation rejection: The CSV parser may be skipping rows with null/invalid fields (e.g., missing dates, malformed numbers).
	•	Backend ingestion issue: Uploaded transactions may lack the required userId, so they are saved but not tied to the current user.
	•	Frontend exclusion: The GET /api/transactions call might be filtering only manual transactions and excluding source=“csv”.

Fix instructions:
	•	Inspect the API used after uploading CSV to refresh transaction data — it must include CSV entries.
	•	When saving parsed CSV entries:
	•	Ensure each row includes a valid userId.
	•	Validate that amount, merchant, and date fields are all in the expected format.
	•	Apply default fallbacks or skip faulty rows gracefully — but log skipped rows for debugging.
	•	Add a "source" field to all transactions and show all sources by default in the frontend log (CSV, manual, Plaid).
	•	Optionally: show an upload preview before submitting the CSV.

Please investigate and resolve these issues comprehensively. They are critical to the usability of the transaction logging system and must be addressed for the v1 production launch.
