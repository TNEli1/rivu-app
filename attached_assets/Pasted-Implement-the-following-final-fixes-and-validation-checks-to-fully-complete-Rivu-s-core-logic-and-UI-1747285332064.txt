Implement the following final fixes and validation checks to fully complete Rivu’s core logic and UI for public readiness. All features must be functioning with accurate, up-to-date data and proper navigation.

⸻

A. TRANSACTIONS – DATE FLEXIBILITY

Issue:
	•	Currently, manual transactions can only be added for today’s date
	•	Users cannot select past or future dates

Fix:
	•	Update the transaction entry form to:
	•	Allow the user to select any valid date (past or future) via a calendar/date picker
	•	Default to today, but do not restrict the range
	•	Backend must:
	•	Accept and save the selected date to MongoDB
	•	Confirm that:
	•	Transactions list remains sorted by date
	•	Insights and charts use the entered date accurately

⸻

B. BUDGET MODULE – VERIFY DATE HANDLING

Fix:
	•	Double-check the budget module (both /budget and dashboard):
	•	Ensure there are no restrictions on when spending data can be entered
	•	If budgets are stored with monthly context, confirm proper grouping and no hardcoded limits

⸻

C. GOALS PAGE – ADD “BACK TO DASHBOARD” BUTTON

Issue:
	•	The goals page loads separately with no way to return to the main app UI

Fix:
	•	Add a visible “Back to Dashboard” button or icon at the top of the /goals page
	•	Route it cleanly to /dashboard
	•	Maintain user session state and any unsaved data should be preserved or confirmed before leaving

⸻

D. RIVU SCORE – FINAL LOGIC VALIDATION

Fix:
	•	Confirm that the Rivu Score is calculated using the following logic:

Components:
	•	Budget adherence (e.g., % of categories staying under budget)
	•	Savings progress (total progress across active savings goals)
	•	Weekly user engagement (login/activity rate over time)

Weighting Example (if not already implemented):

rivuScore = 
  (budgetSuccessRate * 100 * 0.4) +
  (savingsProgressRate * 100 * 0.3) +
  (engagementRate * 100 * 0.3);

•	If no data is available, the score must default to 0
	•	Ensure:
	•	Score updates live when user adds budgets, savings, or logs in repeatedly
	•	The AI Coach receives and uses the correct current Rivu Score, not a placeholder

⸻

Final Expectations
	•	All changes must reflect immediately in the UI
	•	Data must be scoped to authenticated users and saved to MongoDB
	•	No hardcoded values or demo behaviors may remain
	•	Ensure changes are tested in both dark and light mode

A. SESSION & DATA PERSISTENCE – FIX DATA LOSS ON LOGOUT/LOGIN

Issue:
	•	When users log out and log back in, all their saved data (transactions, goals, budget, etc.) disappears

Fix:
	•	Ensure the following:
	•	All user-generated data (transactions, budgets, goals, preferences) is being stored in MongoDB using the logged-in user’s unique ID
	•	On login, the app fetches that user’s data and rehydrates the state
	•	Do not rely on local state or temporary memory for core features
	•	Verify:
	•	JWT authentication is correctly scoped
	•	Backend routes fetch only the current user’s data
	•	State persists across page refresh and session changes
