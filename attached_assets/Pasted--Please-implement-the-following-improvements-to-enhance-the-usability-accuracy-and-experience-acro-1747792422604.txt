Please implement the following improvements to enhance the usability, accuracy, and experience across the Rivu app:

⸻

✅ Grouped by Account – NaN Bug
	•	When viewing transactions grouped by account, some values are returning NaN codes
	•	Fix the logic to ensure proper numerical formatting for balances and totals across all accounts
	•	Validate that account_id and subtype data from Plaid is parsed correctly before performing calculations

⸻

✅ Goals Page – Improve Overall Progress Visibility
	•	On the Goals page, the overall progress percentage is difficult to read due to small font or low contrast
	•	Increase font size or use a higher-contrast color to make the value more legible

⸻

✅ Rivu Logos – Sizing Adjustment
	•	Make the Rivu logo significantly larger on the following pages:
	•	Dashboard (top-left corner or header area)
	•	Login screen
	•	Sign-up screen
	•	Maintain branding consistency across all viewports

⸻

✅ Top Spending Category – Accuracy Fix
	•	Top spending category may still be showing inaccurate or misleading results
	•	Update the logic using this structure:

// Pseudocode for calculating top category
const categoryTotals = {};

transactions.forEach(tx => {
  if (!categoryTotals[tx.category]) {
    categoryTotals[tx.category] = 0;
  }
  categoryTotals[tx.category] += tx.amount;
});

const topCategory = Object.entries(categoryTotals).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])[0];

	Ensure the calculation is filtered by current calendar month and uses only completed (non-pending) transactions

⸻

✅ Coach – Improve Prompting and Add Personalization Settings
	•	Improve coach prompt logic to give better financial advice, grounded in user transaction history, goals, and budgets
	•	Add user preference setting that allows users to choose the coach tone:
	•	“Encouraging”
	•	“Direct”
	•	“Strict”
	•	Save this preference to user profile and tailor GPT prompts accordingly:

// Pseudocode
const tone = user.coachTone || "encouraging";
const prompt = generateCoachPrompt(userData, tone);

Branding – Add ™ to Rivu Score
	•	On all major surfaces where Rivu Score is displayed (dashboard, insights tab, coach references), update to:
	•	Rivu Score™
	•	Apply only once per view to avoid overuse

⸻

✅ Landing Page Update – Plaid + Transaction Options

Add a new section to the landing page that clearly explains how users can connect their financial data. Include the following:
	•	Mention that Rivu partners with Plaid to securely connect bank accounts
	•	Let users know they can also upload CSV files or enter transactions manually
	•	Suggested text:
Seamless Transaction Tracking
Rivu partners with Plaid, the trusted leader in financial connectivity, so you can securely link your bank and credit accounts. Prefer not to connect a bank? No problem — simply upload a CSV or add transactions manually to stay on track.
	•	Style this section in line with the rest of the landing page
	•	Include the Plaid logo or badge if permitted under their brand guidelines

⸻

✅ Rivu Score Branding
	•	Ensure every mention of “Rivu Score” across the app includes the ™ symbol
	•	Examples:
	•	“Your Rivu Score™ this month is 72”
	•	“Improving your Rivu Score™ starts with building better habits”
	•	Apply once per screen/view to avoid clutter

Let us know once these changes are fully implemented. These are the last polish items before launch.

Please confirm each fix is implemented and tested across both desktop and mobile environments. These changes are required to enhance polish and trust before launch.
