Please review and address the following problems immediately. These bugs impact data accuracy, user experience, and onboarding integrity.

⸻

1. Remove Test Data / Preloaded State
	•	Eliminate all preloaded or test user data (likely created during early dev).
	•	Every new user should begin with a clean slate (no transactions, goals, or budgets).
	•	Prevent any shared or global default values from populating on sign-up.

⸻

2. Fix Dashboard Calculations
	•	The top three boxes on the dashboard are calculating incorrectly:
	•	“Monthly Spending” increase shows +396.6% — this seems inflated or broken.
	•	“Monthly Income” displays a number even when there’s no monthly savings — which doesn’t make logical sense.
	•	“Monthly Savings” often shows $0 even when income and spending exist.
	•	Action: Audit the full logic behind all three metrics and correct the formula.
	•	Double-check all math, rounding, and data filters (e.g. by current month only).
	•	Compare results with actual transaction records for the month.

⸻

3. Fix Rivu Score Refresh Buttons
	•	The Rivu Score refresh buttons currently fail to refresh the score.
	•	Investigate whether this is a UI issue, an API call error, or backend logic failure.
	•	Also check that Rivu Score calculations do not unfairly penalize brand new users due to low weekly activity — possibly add a grace logic or time-weighted adjustment.

⸻

4. Fix AI Coach Suggestions Display
	•	Chat prompt suggestions from the AI Coach are cut off visually.
	•	Ensure they are fully visible at all times — at minimum, show full content on hover.
	•	Improve spacing, card style, or container width to accommodate longer suggestions.

⸻

5. Fix Transaction Editing Bug
	•	When users try to edit an existing transaction, the app throws an error.
	•	Debug the PUT/UPDATE transaction logic in both frontend and backend.
	•	Ensure that values like date, amount, category, etc., are editable and persisted correctly.

⸻

6. Default to Dark Mode + Store Preference
	•	The app should launch in dark mode by default, including:
	•	The homepage
	•	The logged-in dashboard
	•	Also, store the user’s preferred theme in PostgreSQL, so it persists across sessions and devices.

⸻

7. Remove Irrelevant UI Elements
	•	In Account Settings, remove this placeholder message:
	•	“Rivu Score 75 based on your financial activity, budget adherence, and savings progress”
	•	Also remove the “Skip onboarding survey” toggle from settings. It should not be visible to users anymore.

⸻

8. Validate All Insights & Chart Logic
	•	Inspect the Insights graphs and charts to ensure they reflect real user data.
	•	Check month-over-month calculations, category distribution percentages, and any percentage changes.
	•	Charts must match the actual underlying transactions and budget data pulled from the database.
