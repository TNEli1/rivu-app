We are preparing Rivu Inc., a Delaware C Corporation, for public launch as a mobile-first fintech platform. The application is hosted on Railway with PostgreSQL and available at https://tryrivu.com. All legal, design, infrastructure, and compliance requirements must now be met.

No regressions, no Replit dependencies, no fallback code.
