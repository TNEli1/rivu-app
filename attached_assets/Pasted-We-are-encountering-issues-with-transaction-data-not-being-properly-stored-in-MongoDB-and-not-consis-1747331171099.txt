We are encountering issues with transaction data not being properly stored in MongoDB and not consistently associated with the correct user.

Follow these instructions exactly. Do not skip validation or make assumptions.

⸻

1. Ensure All Transaction Writes Include userId
	•	Every transaction written to MongoDB must include the authenticated user’s ID.
	•	This applies to manual entries, Plaid-imported data, and updates.

Fix logic:

await db.insert(transactions).values({
  userId: currentUser.id,  // MUST be defined from session/token
  ...otherTransactionFields
});

•	If currentUser.id is not available, do not proceed. Instead, log an error and stop the insert.

⸻

2. Make All MongoDB Writes Fully Awaited and Wrapped in Try/Catch
	•	Do not assume the database write succeeded unless it’s explicitly awaited and error-checked.

Fix logic:

try {
  await db.insert(...);
} catch (err) {
  console.error("MongoDB write failed", err);
}

3. Validate That Writes Are Actually Reaching MongoDB
	•	After each transaction is inserted, immediately run a test fetch using the same userId:

const testResult = await db.select().from(transactions).where(eq(transactions.userId, currentUser.id));
console.log("Verify transaction write:", testResult);

•	If nothing is returned or result is empty, the write did not succeed.

⸻

4. Fix Transaction Fetch Logic (Scoped by User ID)
	•	When fetching transactions (for dashboard, history, etc.), ensure all queries filter by the authenticated user’s ID.

Fix logic:

await db.select().from(transactions).where(eq(transactions.userId, currentUser.id));

5. Check for Schema Mismatch or Required Fields Blocking Writes
	•	Review the transactions schema for .notNull() or .unique() constraints.
	•	Make sure every insert includes:
	•	userId
	•	amount
	•	category
	•	date
	•	source (“manual” or “plaid”)

6. Confirm Data Visibility in MongoDB
	•	Log all successfully written transaction records to console or dev UI.
	•	Check the actual database using the MongoDB dashboard to confirm the data is stored.

⸻

Final Notes:
	•	Do not store or rely on transactions in localStorage or in-memory state across sessions.
	•	Fix all inconsistencies between writing and reading transaction data.
	•	If any Mongo write or read fails, it must be clearly logged and not silently ignored.
