Please finalize the following for the Rivu personal finance web app:

⸻

1. Database & User Data
	•	Switch fully to PostgreSQL — no more MongoDB.
	•	Make sure all user data is being stored in PostgreSQL:
	•	Transaction history
	•	Budget and category data
	•	Savings goals
	•	Rivu Score and subcomponents
	•	Achievement/level progress
	•	AI advice history (optional)
	•	User survey answers (linked to the correct user ID)
	•	Ensure every user is assigned a unique user ID, and all data is scoped to that user.

⸻

Only actions that reflect financial discipline should raise the rivu score:
	•	Hitting or staying within budget
	•	Saving consistently toward a goal
	•	Returning to the app regularly (engagement)
	•	Actually completing a goal
	•	Display Rivu Score subcomponents visually, and ensure they refresh dynamically, not just on logout.

⸻

3. AI Coach Upgrades

Functionality:
	•	Improve GPT prompts for better financial advice. Here are example templates:
	•	“Give me advice based on my top spending categories this month.”
	•	“Am I saving enough based on my income and spending habits?”
	•	“Which goal should I focus on next?”
	•	“How does my spending compare to last month?”
	•	“What are 3 quick ways I can improve my financial health?”

Design:
	•	The AI chat box currently looks unstyled and basic. Please:
	•	Add rounded card edges, spacing, and a proper text area input
	•	Add a soft gradient background or card hover effect for luxury feel
	•	Use consistent fonts and button design from the rest of the app
	•	Add loading animation (e.g. animated dots) while the AI is thinking

⸻

4. Nudge System Implementation

Behavior-based Nudges:
	•	Add an intelligent “nudge” system that reminds users of key behaviors:
	•	Haven’t logged a transaction in 5 days
	•	No activity on a savings goal in 2 weeks
	•	Budget category likely to be exceeded
	•	Weekly spending trend increasing

New User Exception:
	•	Do not show nudges to brand-new users during their first 7 days.
	•	Instead, show onboarding nudges like:
	•	“Welcome to Rivu! Start by creating a budget category.”
	•	“Let’s add your first transaction together.”

Only begin behavior-based nudges after they’ve either:
	•	Had the account for 7+ days
	•	OR completed: 1 budget + 1 transaction + 1 savings goal

Store nudge triggers and responses in the user profile for personalization.

⸻

	•	Ensure all pages (including Goals) stay within the app layout — no full-page redirects
	•	All buttons (e.g. “Already have an account? Log in”) should be functional and navigable.
	•	Update the AI Coach section with better spacing, card layouts, hover effects, and responsiveness.
	•	Ensure scrolling works on all screen sizes, especially on mobile.
	•	
	•	Fix the date picker — allow backdated entries
	•	Connect transaction log on dashboard with full transaction page
	•	Ensure categories have subcategories
	•	Add support for accounts so users don’t retype the same account each time

⸻

6. Data Tracking + Analytics
	•	Data should be persistently tracked over time for each user.
	•	Keep month-by-month tracking to enable long-term habit analysis
	•	Do not discard data even if user is inactive

⸻

This is for a v1 production launch and will be shown to investors. Please proceed carefully and double-check all functionality.
