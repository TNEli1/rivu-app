Delivery: Nudges should appear as a banner or card on the dashboard, and optionally feed the coach prompt.

✅ 3. Improve AI Coach Prompts

Refactor coaching logic to use behavioral context and implicit user data without directly referencing survey inputs.
	•	Avoid phrases like: “Based on your survey response…”
	•	Replace with: “At your stage of life and risk comfort…”
	•	Add variability: some prompts should ask reflective questions, others suggest habits, others praise wins
	•	Futureproof by allowing tone settings (encouraging, direct, strict)

⸻

✅ 4. Upgrade Transaction + Account Tracking System

Enable full multi-account support and richer transaction metadata using Plaid’s account and institution data:
	•	Show transactions grouped by account (e.g., “Amex Credit,” “Chase Checking”)
	•	Include account subtype (e.g., credit, checking, savings) and institution name/logo
	•	Add filter option: view spending by individual account or across all accounts
	•	Display total spend by account on dashboard
	•	Future-ready for categorizing recurring or unexpected transactions

⸻

✅ 5. Reinforce Rivu Score Insights
	•	Add a tooltip or tab explaining how the Rivu Score is calculated
	•	Break down recent Rivu Score changes (e.g., “+8: stayed under budget, –5: no savings this week”)
	•	Restore/update “Last Updated” timestamp for score updates

⸻

✅ 6. UI/UX Polish and Cohesion
	•	Ensure all dashboards and budgeting/goal/transaction pages reflect the latest logic and data
	•	Fix any layout issues on mobile, especially budget, goal, and nudge cards
	•	Optimize the light/dark mode toggle to remember user preference across sessions

⸻

✅ 7. Social and Educational Integration
	•	On the RivU page, include direct links to:
	•	TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tryrivu
	•	Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tryrivu
	•	Substack: https://substack.com/@therivureport
	•	YouTube: https://youtube.com/@tryrivu

⸻

✅ 8. Future Compliance (Optional)

Prepare to support:
	•	“Unlink Bank Account” button (for Plaid 1033 compliance)
	•	Data deletion request flow (via support@tryrivu.com or future in-app toggle)
