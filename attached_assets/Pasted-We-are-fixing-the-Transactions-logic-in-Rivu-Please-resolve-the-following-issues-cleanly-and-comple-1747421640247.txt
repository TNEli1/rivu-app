We are fixing the Transactions logic in Rivu. Please resolve the following issues cleanly and completely:

⸻

1. Transaction Dates Still Default to Today — Fix This

Problem:
All transactions are being saved with the current date, even when the user selects a past date.

Fix:
	•	In the frontend transaction form:
	•	Ensure the date input is of type date and bound correctly
	•	Pass the value as an ISO 8601 string (YYYY-MM-DD) in the request payload
	•	In the backend POST /api/transactions route:
	•	Respect the provided date:

date: validated.date ? new Date(validated.date) : new Date()

Do not overwrite it with new Date() unless it’s missing

Test Case:
Create a transaction from two weeks ago and confirm it stores and displays the correct date across all screens.

2. Remove “(Optional)” Label on Category and Account Fields

Fix:
	•	Category and Account are both required for all transactions.
	•	Remove any (optional) labeling or help text next to these fields
	•	Validate both in the frontend and backend schema:

category: z.string().min(1, "Category is required"),
account: z.string().min(1, "Account is required"),

Add Default Categories to Transactions (Same as Budget)

Fix:
	•	Use the same default category list already used in the budget section.
	•	In the transaction form, populate the category dropdown with these suggestions:

{
  "Housing": ["Rent", "Mortgage", "HOA"],
  "Utilities": ["Electric", "Water", "Gas"],
  "Groceries": ["Produce", "Snacks"],
  "Transportation": ["Gas", "Insurance"],
  "Entertainment": ["Dining Out", "Streaming"],
  "Health": ["Doctor", "Pharmacy"],
  "Savings": ["Emergency Fund"],
  "Income": ["Job", "Side Hustle"]
}

•	Allow the user to still type a custom category if needed.

4. Make Account a Persistent Dropdown Per User

Fix:
	•	Allow users to define and reuse accounts (e.g., “Checking”, “Credit Card”, “Venmo”)
	•	Store a list of custom account names per user in MongoDB:

user: {
  id: 123,
  accounts: ["Wells Fargo", "Chase", "Cash"]
}

•	When adding a new transaction:
	•	The Account field should show a dropdown with the user’s saved accounts
	•	If the user enters a new account name not in the list:
	•	Save it to their accounts[] array for future use
	•	Implement autocomplete or dropdown suggestion in the UI

⸻

Final Expectations:
	•	All fixes must be fully functional across frontend and backend
	•	No hardcoded, demo, or placeholder data
	•	All category/account behavior must persist and match user input
