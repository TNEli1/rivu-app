A. SAVINGS GOALS SYSTEM (NEW MODULE)

Requirements:
	•	Create a new “Savings Goals” section accessible from both:
	•	The main dashboard
	•	A dedicated /goals page or module

Functionality:
	•	Users must be able to:
	•	Add a new savings goal:
	•	Fields: name, target amount, target date (optional)
	•	Delete any goal
	•	Update amount saved toward the goal at any time

Backend:
	•	Save all goal data to MongoDB
	•	Calculate and store:
	•	% progress toward each goal
	•	Monthly breakdown (saved this month vs. previous months)

B. RIVU SCORE – LOGIC & AI SYNC

Fixes:
	1.	Score Logic Validation
	•	Ensure Rivu Score updates based on:
	•	Budget adherence
	•	Savings progress
	•	Weekly login engagement
	•	Score should show 0 if no qualifying data
	•	Score must update in real-time
	2.	AI Coach Awareness
	•	Inject the actual calculated Rivu Score into the AI Coach’s context so it can:
	•	Respond with accurate insights
	•	Avoid displaying hardcoded or fake values
	•	GPT prompt should receive:
rivuScore, budgetProgress, savingsGoalProgress

⸻

C. MONTHLY TRACKING & INSIGHTS

Fixes:
	•	In /insights > Monthly Trends:
	•	Chart labeled “Monthly Income vs Expenses” must:
	•	Pull real transaction data (manual + Plaid)
	•	Group by month (e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar…)
	•	Include both:
	•	Total income per month
	•	Total expenses per month
	•	Apply similar monthly tracking to:
	•	Budget history
	•	Savings goal progress
	•	Rivu Score history (if needed)

⸻

D. UI CLEANUP – REMOVE DEMO OR STATIC LOGIC

Fixes:
	1.	Remove from Settings:
	•	The toggle to “Skip Onboarding Survey”
	2.	Remove from Account Settings Page:
	•	The section near the Logout button that describes or hardcodes the Rivu Score
	3.	Ensure all data shown across settings, dashboard, and insights is live
	•	Remove any static text about score, status, or placeholders

⸻

E. RECOMMENDED FINAL ADDITION (Optional but Smart)

AI Context Refresh Logic
	•	Add a background check or update hook that ensures:
	•	GPT always has the latest Rivu Score + key financial indicators
	•	Example: refresh AI input data after user adds goal, updates budget, or links a bank

This keeps advice relevant without needing user to reload the app
