Please conduct a full audit and double-check all functionality, security, and compliance work completed to date. We need to confirm that Rivu is stable, properly branded, and compliant — especially if international users begin signing up.

⸻

1. Database & Environment
	•	Confirm the app is connected to the correct Render PostgreSQL database via DATABASE_URL from secrets.
	•	Ensure no references to NeonDB remain in code or secrets.
	•	Validate all migrations have been applied and tables (like users) exist and are in use.

⸻

2. Signup & Email Verification
	•	Confirm the following:
	•	Email verification flow works end-to-end using Postmark
	•	Emails are sent from support@tryrivu.com
	•	No reference to “Rivu Finance” in subject/body
	•	Emails use Rivu branding and colors (e.g., #00C2A8)
	•	After signup, users are routed to the login page and blocked from logging in until they verify

⸻

3. Login, Password Reset, and Security
	•	Confirm:
	•	Users cannot bypass verification to log in
	•	Password reset email works and is styled correctly
	•	POSTMARK_API_KEY is securely used from secrets
	•	No sensitive data or full tokens are logged

⸻

4. International Readiness
	•	Ensure the app is ready for non-U.S. users by:
	•	Detecting and logging user country (via IP or geolocation logic)
	•	Showing a notice if the user is outside the U.S.
	•	Privacy policy and terms are linked and include global data use
	•	Data deletion/export endpoints are built or planned

⸻

5. Final Code & Config Cleanup
	•	Ensure no duplicate or conflicting API base URL logic (e.g., localhost fallback in prod)
	•	Remove any deprecated dev/test secrets or config files
	•	Ensure all logic is environment-aware (NODE_ENV checks, etc.)

⸻

6. Log All Findings in TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md
	•	For each confirmed feature or fix, log:
	•	Title of feature/fix
	•	Status (working/not working)
	•	Files updated or confirmed
	•	Any outstanding gaps

Let me know once everything is reviewed, confirmed, and documented. We need to ensure launch-readiness and avoid regressions.
