Please fix the following recurring issues that are affecting core functionality and blocking launch:

⸻

1. Login Form - Enter Key Misbehavior

Issue: Pressing “Enter” after entering credentials redirects to the “Forgot Password” page instead of submitting the login form.
Fix:
	•	Ensure the login form has a <form> element with a proper onSubmit handler.
	•	Make sure the password input is not capturing Enter and redirecting unless explicitly intended.
	•	Confirm that type="submit" is used for the Sign In button, not just onClick.

2. Join iOS Waitlist Button – Still Throws Error

Issue: Submitting the waitlist form shows “Thanks” then immediately displays an error.
Fix:
	•	Verify that the form submission logic is properly sending data to Postmark or the configured destination.
	•	Ensure the EMAIL_TO value in the backend is set to support@tryrivu.com and not the EMAIL_FROM.
	•	Check server logs for the actual error and log full stack trace in troubleshooting.md.

3. Tutorial Not Showing for New Users

Issue: New users still aren’t seeing the onboarding tutorial.
Fix:
	•	Ensure tutorialCompleted is initialized as false in the DB schema for every new user.
	•	Make sure the frontend checks this flag and triggers the tutorial modal accordingly after login.
	•	Validate the DB migration ran successfully and is applied in the production environment.

4. Delete All My Data – Deletes User Before Data

Issue: Clicking “Delete All My Data” deletes the user first, then tries to delete data, causing orphaned records or errors.
Fix:
	•	Update the flow to first delete all associated data (transactions, goals, nudges, sessions, etc.), then delete the user record.
	•	Ensure the logic is wrapped in a transaction so partial deletes don’t leave corrupt state.
	•	Add proper logging to confirm sequence and failures, and document the behavior in troubleshooting.md.

These bugs have resurfaced multiple times and require careful validation after fixing. Please test each fix on production before closing it out.
