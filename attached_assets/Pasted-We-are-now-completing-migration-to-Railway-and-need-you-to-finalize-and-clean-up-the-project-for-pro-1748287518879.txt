We are now completing migration to Railway and need you to finalize and clean up the project for production.

Do the following immediately:

✅ 1. Use Correct Environment Variables
	•	Make sure process.env.BASE_URL is used instead of any hardcoded localhost URLs
	•	Confirm all secrets (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, SESSION_SECRET, POSTMARK_API_KEY, PLAID_*, etc.) are being read from process.env
	•	Ensure there are no hardcoded API keys, tokens, or localhost references

✅ 2. Remove All Replit-Specific Code
	•	Remove @replit/vite-plugin-* packages from package.json
	•	Clean up vite.config.ts and remove any process.env.REPL_ID logic
	•	Remove any logic or plugins that exist only for Replit’s preview or proxy systems
	•	Kill anything relying on Replit’s default PostgreSQL (Neon)

✅ 3. Validate PostgreSQL Migration
	•	Confirm all Drizzle schema tables exist in the Railway PostgreSQL DB
	•	Run npx drizzle-kit push using the Railway DATABASE_URL
	•	Ensure tables like users, sessions, transactions, goals, etc. are properly deployed

✅ 4. Check for Syntax Bugs and Routing Issues
	•	Scan for missing imports, typos, and route mismatches
	•	Confirm all API routes are valid, error-handled, and mounted correctly
	•	Ensure Express middleware runs in the proper order (auth, CORS, redirects, etc.)

✅ 5. Lock Down Redirect Logic

Add this middleware to redirect all root domain traffic to www.tryrivu.com:

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const host = req.headers.host;
  if (host === 'tryrivu.com') {
    return res.redirect(301, 'https://www.tryrivu.com' + req.originalUrl);
  }
  next();
});

✅ 6. Clean Build for Railway
	•	Make sure the start script builds and runs both frontend and backend correctly
	•	Validate all routes load (static assets, API, React pages)
	•	Confirm PORT is dynamically assigned from process.env.PORT

⸻

This is a full production push-off. Finalize the app, clean the codebase, and confirm everything is using Railway-compatible logic. No preview logic, no dev-only scripts, no broken routes. Get it clean and functional.
