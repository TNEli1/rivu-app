We need deep fixes to the following production bugs in the Rivu app (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Railway):

⸻

1. 500 Error on “Clear All Transactions”

Symptom: Pressing “Clear All” button returns 500 internal server error
Root Cause: Likely trying to delete transactions after user/session is revoked
Fix:
	•	In /clear-all route:
	•	Use transaction: first delete transactions, goals, budgets tied to user ID
	•	Then delete user
	•	Finally, revoke session
	•	Wrap in try/catch, log exact error to troubleshooting.md

⸻

2. Plaid: Unable to Initialize Connection

Symptom: Plaid Connect button fails — returns initialization error
Root Cause: Plaid OAuth redirect URI is not yet whitelisted for tryrivu.com
Fix:
	•	Add https://tryrivu.com and https://www.tryrivu.com to Plaid’s allowed redirect URIs
	•	Update any frontend Plaid redirect_uri calls if hardcoded

3. CSV Upload: No Data Saved

Symptom: Upload UI shows success toast, but:
	•	No transactions appear
	•	No rows saved in DB
Root Cause:
	•	Backend not saving parsed rows
	•	Possible missing DB transaction or improper schema field mapping
Fix:
	•	Ensure /upload-csv API:
	•	Parses rows with correct date, category, amount format
	•	Maps to correct user_id
	•	Inserts into transactions with confirmation
	•	Logs count of inserted rows in console + troubleshooting.md

4. Account Deletion Logic: Data Still Exists

Symptom: Deleting account triggers logout, but user data remains
Root Cause: Deletion order is wrong — user is deleted before related data
Fix:
	•	Fix /delete-user to:
	1.	Auth → Confirm session or token
	2.	Delete transactions, goals, budget, etc.
	3.	Then delete from users
	4.	Destroy session at the end
	•	Verify all deletions using rowCount or returning clauses

5. Tutorial Does Not Show for New Users

Symptom: New accounts skip the onboarding/tutorial
Root Cause: Likely hasSeenTutorial flag is either:
	•	Defaulting to true
	•	Not being checked on first login
Fix:
	•	In DB users table, ensure default: has_seen_tutorial = false
	•	In frontend:
	•	On login success, check has_seen_tutorial
	•	If false, launch tutorial component
	•	After completion, PATCH user with has_seen_tutorial = true

⸻

6. Email Verification Not Sent

Symptom: No email ever received after registration
Root Cause: Backend not sending POST request to Postmark or using incorrect from address
Fix:
	•	Check sendVerificationEmail():
	•	Confirm it’s hitting Postmark API with correct from, to, and template ID
	•	Set support@tryrivu.com as verified sender in Postmark dashboard
	•	Log Postmark response in console + troubleshooting.md
	•	Temporarily log generated token in console for manual verification test

7. Add a Persistent troubleshooting.md File

Purpose: Track all known bugs, symptoms, root causes, and date of fix
