We‚Äôre deployed full stack on Railway with a PostgreSQL database. Please help us double-check our integration for the two following critical production issues:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Issue 1: Google OAuth Login Failure
	‚Ä¢	Google OAuth successfully creates the user account.
	‚Ä¢	However, after redirect, the user is not logged in ‚Äî they are returned to the login screen.
	‚Ä¢	The user has no password or login credentials and is effectively locked out.

üîç Please review and help us verify for these common issues (without using any Replit dependencies):
	‚Ä¢	Is passport.serializeUser() and passport.deserializeUser() implemented correctly?
	‚Ä¢	Is the OAuth callback correctly generating a session or JWT after authentication?
	‚Ä¢	Is the req.login() or equivalent being called after OAuth to persist the session?
	‚Ä¢	Is the frontend consuming the login response properly and setting a cookie or session token?
	‚Ä¢	Are we returning a correct 200 response from the OAuth callback handler?

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Issue 2: Plaid Always Shows Phone Number Screen (No Bank List)
	‚Ä¢	After launching Plaid Link, users are taken directly to the OAuth phone number screen, even for banks that do not require OAuth.

üîç Please verify the following Plaid-related issues (again ‚Äî no Replit dependencies):
	‚Ä¢	Is our link_token being persisted properly across OAuth redirect using sessionStorage, cookies, or query params?
	‚Ä¢	Are we checking for isPlaidOauthRedirect() before calling Plaid.create() and restoring the original token?
	‚Ä¢	Are we accidentally creating a new link_token on every load, including during the OAuth return?
	‚Ä¢	Is the redirect_uri exactly matching what is set in the Plaid dashboard?
	‚Ä¢	Are the CORS or CSP headers blocking Plaid flow?

‚∏ª

These issues are blocking production use, and we need permanent solutions today.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
	‚Ä¢	We are not using Replit for hosting ‚Äî we are on Railway.
	‚Ä¢	Do not use any Replit-only logic or packages.

Please help confirm the best practice approach and common fixes so we can resolve these once and for all.
